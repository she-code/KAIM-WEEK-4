# 📦 Amharic E-commerce Data Extractor for EthioMart

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to transform messy Telegram posts from Ethiopian e-commerce channels into a smart FinTech engine that identifies top vendors suitable for loans. EthioMart wants to centralize fragmented Telegram e-commerce data into one unified platform by extracting structured business entities such as product names, prices, and locations from unstructured Amharic text, images, and documents.

## 🔑 Key Objectives

- Develop a repeatable pipeline: data ingestion → preprocessing → labeling → structured data output.
- Fine-tune transformer-based models (e.g., XLM-Roberta, mBERT) for Amharic Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract Product, Price, and Location entities with high accuracy (F1-score).
- Compare multiple NER approaches and interpret model predictions using SHAP and LIME.
- Deliver actionable recommendations on the best model aligned to EthioMart’s business needs.
